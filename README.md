# Hi Lea!!
This is the submission for Lab2 and Lab3.

## Lab2
### SQL Section
The SQL part can be found in "lab2-final(sql).txt" containing the necessary code to complete the tasks.

### Linq Section
The models for the authors and books are in AuthorBook/Models. The endpoints are in the AuthorBook/Controllers. 

I also have a little confession to make. In AuthorBook, I was following a tutorial online and didnt use postgres, I told you about it in class and fixred it locally without pushing again. So in case this makes it any better, I will attach the correct connectionstring here: 
"ConnectionStrings": {"DefaultConnection": "Host=localhost; Port=5432; Username=postgres; Password=postgres; Database=DatabaseDemo"}.

## Lab3
### Database First
This task can be found in lab3/AuthorBook2.
I added the odata queries in the end of AuthorBook2/Program.cs as comments.

### Code First
This solution can be found in lab3/School.
the models are in School/Models. Dbcontext is in School/Data. Endpoints in School/Controllers. And the mapping is in School/Mapping.
